; ------------------- yes-or-no-p ---------------------
; There are a number of situations where Emacs wants to ask me a question,
; but the answer is always the same (or, it's easy to get the effect of
; the other answer afterwards).  The main example is the question:
;
;   File foo.txt has changed on disk.  Reread from disk?
;
; This question is annoying because it gets asked while I'm moving around
; in a debugger stack trace, and often don't care about the file I happen
; to be at (because I want to move past that frame anyway).  Moreover,
; my F12 binding lets me re-read files with a single keystroke, so if I
; actually *do* want to re-read it's easy to do.

; First, I need the original definition of yes-or-no-p so I can call it
; after I've replaced its definition.  In case .emacs gets re-read
; after startup, avoid losing the original definition.
(if (fboundp 'orig-yes-or-no-p)
	nil        ; it's already bound, don't re-bind
	(fset 'orig-yes-or-no-p (symbol-function 'yes-or-no-p))
)

; Now, define my version in terms of `orig-yes-or-no-p'.
(defun yes-or-no-p (prompt)
	"Ask user a yes-or-no question.  Return t if answer is yes, nil if no.

			 ; This message is created in lisp/files.el, and there are four

		; it's that question; the answer is no, but I *do* want to know
		; that it has changed
		(progn (message "Note: File has changed on disk.") nil)

		; it's a different question; for now, just ask me; I'll probably
		; add more patterns to the above as I think of other questions that
